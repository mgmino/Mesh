Controllers: controllers attach and manage values/functionality tied to the $scope. Ultimately $scope tends to be heavily presentation driven. IE its a view model.
Services: services tend to tie in infrastructure, backend, or other browser features
Directives: directives allow you to integrate with DOM events/functionality not handled by existing handlers.
